# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 14, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Setup Linux/Xubuntu. Messed around with command line with the native terminal.

**Thoughts:** Fairly simplistic and easy so far, just making progress with the Odin Project


### Day 1: June 15, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learned about Git and Github, practiced making a repository and pushing/pulling to it from the command line. Next I have to work through the responsive web design through free code camp.

**Thoughts:** Pretty cool feature, github is still a little confusing to me.


### Day 2: June 16, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Went through free code camps CSS lessons, and am now working on their applied visual design lessons

**Thoughts:** Since I've done CS50 before I had experience with CSS, but I was still able to learn new things and found the tutorials to be quite informative. 


### Day 3: June 17, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Continued freecodecamps lessons. Finished applied visual design lessons, applied accessibility, and responsive web design principles.

**Thoughts:** Most of the features I learned today with CSS were completely new to me, and greatly opened my eyes on how in depth the style can be. The accessbility knowledge was cool as well, as it was something I had never put much thought into before.


### Day 4: June 18, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished the flexbox and grid lessons in freecodecamp, now I have to make five different web pages.

**Thoughts:** Thoroughly enjoyed the lessons as I had messed with these concepts back in CS50, but never had a proper understanding for how they worked. Now ready to start on the webpages.


### Day 5: June 19, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Started on the tribute page, finished up 8/10 user stories. Used and learned a lot about CSS and some html.

**Thoughts:** Making good progress and can feel myself retaining what I'm learning, the webpage will be simple but I'm feeling good about what I've made so far.


### Day 6: June 20, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Spent hours messing around with CSS, didn't make much progress on the site at all.

**Thoughts:** Struggled to comprehend many aspects of CSS, saddened by how much time I spent on it but hopefully next time will be better.


### Day 7: June 21, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished the tribute webpage with all tests passing.

**Thoughts:** Compared to yesterday, today's progress was efficient and I finished the page with ease. It's simplistic, but I'm happy with it.


### Day 8: June 22, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Created and finished the survey webpage.

**Thoughts:** Functionality was easy and I found myself finishing it within the hour. The CSS is still difficult for me to I found myself mostly copying FCC's example. However, I learned a lot more about CSS by doing so.


### Day 9: June 23, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Created the product landing webpage.

**Thoughts:** Was a busier today so didn't have as much time. Manged to create the navbar easily with functionality. CSS is coming more naturally to me now and I find myself grasping more concepts more easily.


### Day 10: June 24, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Created the email submission and aligned the layout with flex, played around with more css functions. Also applied fixed position to navbar.

**Thoughts:** Only an hour today but didn't struggle as much as I thought I would. Css is slowly becoming easier and more intuitive the more I use it. Still need to mess with grid further as well.


### Day 11: June 25, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished the landing site, then started on the tech documentation site. 

**Thoughts:** Landing site didn't really teach me anything new but helped my muscle memory, tech site should be fairly simple


### Day 12: June 26, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished the tech doc site.

**Thoughts:** In terms of the subject, I merely copied the example. However, all the code I wrote myself. Learned more about media queries today, as well as how to make better navbars.


### Day 13: June 27, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Started the portfolio site.

**Thoughts:** Getting much more comfortable with CSS and HTML by this point, finding myself needing to google less and can create and manipulate what I want mostly from memory. Overall happy!


### Day 14: June 28, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished the portfolio site

**Thoughts:** In terms of the site layout I feel I did a fine job, however I couldn't figure out how to design it for mobile. I played around with media queries but it's still really confusing. In the future I'll consider designing sites for mobile as the priority.


### Day 15: June 29, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Started google homepage

**Thoughts:** Have to recreat google homepage. Learned about google free fonts and icons, created a pretty good search bar as well. Feeling more confidant with CSS and html.


### Day 16: June 30, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished google homepage

**Thoughts:** It's nearly identical to the original homepage! I can tell that I've improved a lot.


### Day 17: July 1, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Worked on JS fundamentals in TOP

**Thoughts:** Learned about declaring variables, delcarations to avoid, numbers and arithmatic, precedence in operators, unary and binary, pre-fixing and post-fixing. As well as a few other minor things.


### Day 18: July 2, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learned more JS fundamentals, such as syntax, common datatypes, boolean and condition stuff

**Thoughts:** Nothing too crazy, just absorbing the new syntax


### Day 19: July 3, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Continued JS fundamentals. Polished my knowledge on datatpes, conditions, switchs, did some js exercises.

**Thoughts:** Getting more comrortable with the syntax now


### Day 20: July 4, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Worked on JS functions.

**Thoughts:** It was good to brush up on them since it's been a while since I used them in CS50, learned the difference between func delcarations and func expressions. As well as arrow functions


### Day 21: July 5, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Worked on problem solving skills

**Thoughts:** Watched an hour lecture on how to think like a programmer, which really focused on the right steps and mindset to have. I feel like this is a part of me I have neglected and am going to work hard to change it and improve my mindset


### Day 22: July 6, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Created Rock, Paper, Scissors

**Thoughts:** Created a JS program that replicates an RPS game. I utilized functions almost entirely, switch statements, while loops, and more. Comparatively to weeks ago, it all came relatively easy and I feel proud of my growth


### Day 23: July 7, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learned about arrays

**Thoughts:** Very short day, had lots of trouble focusing. Just going to take it easy.


### Day 24: July 8, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learned more about JS loops.

**Thoughts:** Not that different from loops in other languages, althought a refresher was nice


### Day 25: July 8, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Went through various JS exercises

**Thoughts:** Still running through fundamentals on TOP, did various JS exercises such as temp conversion, sumall, removeFromArray, repeatString, leapYear, and a couple more. Not too challenging, the syntax is starting to really stick


### Day 26: July 11, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learned about DOM and became more familar with it

**Thoughts:** Learned a bit on the JS syntax. Next projects focus on recreating a drum-kit and also adding a UI to my rock, paper, scissors game


### Day 27: July 12, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Worked on and finished the drum kit

**Thoughts:** I feel like I had the right ideas, but was unable to complete the project on my own due to lack of syntax and general knowledge of DOM. In particlar, query selectors and keycodes were confusing before watching the tutorial.


### Day 28: July 13, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the RPS project

**Thoughts:** Got stumped for a while because I accidentally called my script file twice, thus redeclaring everything and giving me errors. Then got stumped on how to update the score in real time, decided to make it a function and just recall it each time the score updated. Overall not too bad.


### Day 29: July 15, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished the RPS project

**Thoughts:** I thought that I did everything right, but when I tested "playing again", the game broke. I got stuck for a while but after trial and error I understood my mistakes, such as calling a function more than I should have and ways to simplify things with more functions. 


### Day 30: July 16, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Started the Etch-a-sketch project

**Thoughts:** Worked more with grid which was cool, understanding how it works a lot more. Created a dynamic grid along with the function to change color. Next I need to implement a refresh button, and possible a grander color changer.


### Day 31: July 18, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished Etch-a-Sketch

**Thoughts:** Implemented the ability to change grid size. When I finished it, it was very barebones. After looking at a few examples from other students, I was able to spice mine up further while only using my own knowledge to do so. I could add more, such as different colors and functions. For now I'm satisfied


### Day 32: July 19, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learned about JS objects, did various array exercises and learned about array-specific functions such as map, sort, find, reduce. Also completed two JS exercises, calculator and palindromes

**Thoughts:** JS objects were incredibly similar to Python disctionaries, so that knowledge made my understanding of it increasingly easier. The array exercises were all easy except for reduce, but I feel better about it now. Calculator was simplistic, palindromes I completed but I know it could be much more optimal.


### Day 33: July 20, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished Js exercises.

**Thoughts:** Short session, I've got a much better grasp on JS syntax now. Tomorrow I start on the big calculator project


### Day 34: July 21, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Started Calculator project

**Thoughts:** The ability to use Grid suddenly clicked with me as I easily created the calculators format, the css was really easy too. I got majority of the functionality down but I feel like there's plenty of room for improvement.


### Day 35: July 22, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Worked on calculator 

**Thoughts:** Spent the entire time bug fixing. Clear wasn't functioning right but I think I got it sorted. Also the operators functioned weird if you used them back-to-back without selecting a new value each time. Also believe to have fixed them. Still need to fix decimals, percent, number limiter, add backspace, and add keyboard functionality 


### Day 36: July 23, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Worked on calculator, finished for now.

**Thoughts:** Spent more time bugfixing. Not entirely satisified with it and believe it can be improved still, but I'll save that for another day. It's basic functions work just fine, although I'm sure I could improve the way I coded it as well. 



### Day 37: July 25, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Started Fullstack JS, Javascript lessons. Learned about object prototypes and inheritance.

**Thoughts:** Still slightly confusing, but I think I managed a good grasp on the concept.


### Day 38: July 26, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Started Library project

**Thoughts:** Figured out how to make a responsive table entirely through js manipulating the DOM. Got more comfortable using objects as well.



### Day 39: July 27, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Library project

**Thoughts:** Feeling very comfortable manipulating the DOM. Created a few functions easily, now attempting to make the program more dynamic



### Day 40: July 28, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Library project

**Thoughts:** Feeling very happy with my progress. Funcionality of the project so far is perfect, the code is clean with plenty of functions (but not too many). I managed to use JSON to store localstorage. Now I only need to add better CSS



### Day 41: July 29, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Library project

**Thoughts:** Mostly worked on CSS, which I'm so much more comfortble with now. Need to upgrade the CSS of the actual book cells next



### Day 42: July 30, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished Library project

**Thoughts:** Very satisfied with the final result!


### Day 43: July 31, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learned about JS factory functions and modules

**Thoughts:** Extremely confused about all of this, going to watch more tutorials and read more docs on the process because I don't quite get it. Have to start the tic-tac-toe project next which will make use of this knowledge as well


### Day 44: August 1st, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Started tic-tac-toe

**Thoughts:** After watching the tutorials I'm much less confused on modules and factories. However, tic-tac-toe is proving to be very difficult for me and I'm struggling hard. 


### Day 45: August 2, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Worked on tic-tac-toe

**Thoughts:** Extremely short day, didn't get to do much. But I have a better understanding on modules


### Day 46: August 3, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Worked on tic-tac-toe

**Thoughts:** Added some more functions, improved my modules, added style. so far so good



### Day 47: August 4, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished tic-tac-toe

**Thoughts:** Finalized it! Feeling pretty accomplished with my work, curious as to where I can go to have someone critique my code. 


### Day 48: August 5, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learned about JS classes

**Thoughts:** Pretty confusing at first but eventually I started to understand it, but as of now I don't really see much of a big use other than it just being syntax sugar


### Day 49: August 6, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learned about ES6 modules, NPM, and webpack

**Thoughts:** A bit overwhelming but I grasp the concept, now I just need to really learn and utilize the aspects of it in practice



### Day 50: August 8, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Continued to learn about webpack and making servers with it

**Thoughts:** Starting to understand NPM and webpack a lot more, but it'll be a while before I'm really comfortable with it. Have to start the restaurant project now


### Day 51: August 9, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Started on restaurant project

**Thoughts:** exporting and importing is really confusing right now, mostly the concept of importing/exporting module syntax. 



### Day 52: August 11, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Continued restaurant project

**Thoughts:** Mostly worked on css, so far so good. Learned about z-index and got more familar with relative and absolute positioning



### Day 53: August 12, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Continued restaurant project

**Thoughts:** Worked more on CSS but also created the switching tab function and the load page function. I got better with my transitions and how to apply it to removing a DOM element. Feeling good!


### Day 54: August 13, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Continued restaurant project

**Thoughts:** Finished the menu page and it looks really clean. Used CSS grid pretty easily to do it too.


### Day 55: August 14, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished restaurant project

**Thoughts:** Finished the contact page and cleaned up the code, really satisified with the final project.


### Day 56: August 16, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Started todo list

**Thoughts:** Feeling a lot faster and comfortable with starting projects. Such as installing with npm, setting everything up, basic html and css. Things like that


### Day 57: August 17, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Worked on todo list

**Thoughts:** Made the tab switching logic in a snap, now working on the add task logic. Taking notes from my library project


### Day 58: August 18, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Worked on todo list

**Thoughts:** Short day. Made a functioning form that runs through a constructor to make a task, debating now how I want to store each task.


### Day 59: August 19, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Worked on todo list

**Thoughts:** Changed my mind on how to separate modules, so I deleted some of the pages I had. Struggling to grasp the most effcient way to go about this, but I'm making progress. Hopefully it turns out well



### Day 60: August 20, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Worked on todo list

**Thoughts:** Had a bit of a breakthrough understanding how class methods work, had an easier time implementing delete and checkoff functions. Made a simple sort function to sort tasks by priority



### Day 61: August 21, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Worked on todo list

**Thoughts:** Another short day but a good one. Learned more about local storage and how it works. Realized that objects get stored as strings, so you have to construct their behavior again when restoring them. Valuable lessons learned


### Day 62: August 22, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Worked on todo list

**Thoughts:** Improved the checklist function and tidied the code some more by moving functions to their appropriate modules. Started working on projects


### Day 63: August 23, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Worked on todo list

**Thoughts:** Addded the ability to save tasks into projects and delete projects.


### Day 64: August 24, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Worked on todo list

**Thoughts:** Added edit function, implemented foundation for kabob menu. I'm closing in now on the functions and then can finally start on the css. So far so good!


### Day 65: August 25, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Worked on todo list

**Thoughts:** Added edit project functions, added notes function, made the app logic flow nicer


### Day 66: August 26, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Worked on todo list

**Thoughts:** Started on CSS finally. Gave some icons to the main projects, then spent hours struggling with making dynamic dropdowns and absolute positioning. However, I think I understood at the very end what I need to do


### Day 67: August 27, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Worked on todo list

**Thoughts:** Happy with the dropdowns for now but could still improve it. However, I'm steadily becoming more familar with positioning, and getting more comfortable with em/rem measurements. 


### Day 68: August 28, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Worked on todo list

**Thoughts:** Started on main design for the list, pretty happy with it so far. Fixed a few bugs and improved flow of logic a bit


### Day 69: August 30, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Worked on todo list

**Thoughts:** Continued to update design, finished counters for tasks. Need to finish the display for notes and add final touches



### Day 70: August 31, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Worked on todo list

**Thoughts:** Finished display for notes, believe my logic is sound. I can optimize it further, but right now the goal is to just make it work well enough. Will add final design next.



### Day 71: September 2, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished todo list

**Thoughts:** Finalized and deployed. The code can be optimized further but I'm happy to see that it works soundly. Once I get more tools under my belt I might revamp it to be way better



### Day 72: September 3, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learned about linting, made an image carousel, installed VScode extensions

**Thoughts:** Was able to make the carousel pretty simply. Linting is cool and so are the extensions I installed, but I'm not sure if they're all active as is or if I need to make that happen. 



### Day 73: September 7, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learned about validity in forms and toyed with it, learned about ES2015/ECMA stuff. Learned a bit more on JSON and how to call it from a url. Started learning about Async

**Thoughts:** Been feeling burnt out but I'm going to keep pushing. So far so good on what I learned, Async looks like it'll be tough to get a grip on but gotta get into it and find out.


### Day 74: September 8, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learned about async, callbacks and callback hell. Learned briefly about promises, but tomorrow will dive into a much deeper explanation and breakdown on them

**Thoughts:** The concepts so far have been easy enough to grasp, asycn and callbacks (since I've been using callbacks anyway). I understand the concept of promises as well, but it'll take some time for me to familiarize myself with the syntax


### Day 75: September 9, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Read a huge breakdown on promises

**Thoughts:** That was a LOT to take in. I learned more than enough about promises. The actual implementation of them is still confusing, but I believe that's because I've yet to code one myself. However, the concepts of them make perfect sense


### Day 76: September 10, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learned about API's, async/await syntax

**Thoughts:** async/await syntax seems right up my alley, but I need to use promise syntax too so I get comfortable with it. API's are really cool and clear up a lot about how a lot of websites I've seen filter data ands return it to the user


### Day 77: September 13, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Started weather project

**Thoughts:** I've gotten faster at using webpack and npm to start projects. Gathering the data from the api was easy enough so far, now working on displaying the information


### Day 78: September 14, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Continued weather project. Collected more data, started on some design

**Thoughts:** Collecting the data was pretty simplistic, I've now begun on style which also feels like it will be pretty simple


### Day 79: September 16, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Continued weather project

**Thoughts:** Added function to change temp, added more design, added hourly forecast. So far all of the concepts are pretty simple



### Day 80: September 17, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Continued weather project

**Thoughts:** Created a serparate module for rendering. Finished adding all data I believe. Now only need to work on style. Also copied a draggable scroll from stack overflow in true programmer fashion



### Day 81: September 18, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished weather project

**Thoughts:** Really happy with the way it turned out! finished it faster than I thought


### Day 82: September 20, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Started learning about test runners

**Thoughts:** Watched some lectures and videos on it, have a pretty fair understanding of the concepts. Going to use them in practicd next



### Day 83: September 21, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learned more about test runners, played around with Jest, learned about mocking

**Thoughts:** Have a decent understanding on testing now, going to get more experience with the next project. Battleship


### Day 84: September 22, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Started on battleship project

**Thoughts:** Wrapping my head around testing first is pretty difficult, and I'mn pretty unfamilar with Jest still. Hoping to get more familar as time goes on


### Day 85: September 23, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Worked on battleship project

**Thoughts:** As of now I find tests very annoying and confusing. This project is also quite tough for me to wrap my head around and I'm hoping I don't struggle too much. Today I only created some factories, functions, and struggled with the test runner



### Day 86: September 24, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Worked on battleship project

**Thoughts:** Tests are still annoying but I had a bit of a breakthrough with them. Started working on the dom now


### Day 87: September 25, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Worked on battleship project

**Thoughts:** I'm starting to see the light more with tests, I feel like the logic of my code is really sound so far.


### Day 88: September 27, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Worked on battleship project

**Thoughts:** Having a really tough time wrapping my head around the logic. Felt like I hit a big wall today, but managed to chip away at it some. I _think_ my logic is still sound enough.


### Day 89: September 30, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Worked on battleship project

**Thoughts:** Slow and steady progress. Currently need to work on collision checking (which feels like tha hardest part to me)



### Day 90: October 1, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Worked on battleship project

**Thoughts:** managed to implement the collision checking! Also made the enemy ship placement random. Started on hover when placing ships, need to start design soon


### Day 91: October 2, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Worked on battleship project

**Thoughts:** nearing the finish line. Started implementing design, game functions all work good. Had frustrating issues getting img assets to work, but figured it out in the end.


### Day 92: October 4, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished on battleship project

**Thoughts:** Completed! That was really tough to wrap my head around, but I feel accomplished in what I did. I felt like my logic stayed sound and continued on a straight track without getting diverted much. Learned some new aspects about design and syntax as well. Now onto React!


### Day 93: October 6, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Started learning react

**Thoughts:** It's so cool


### Day 94: October 9, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Started on cv-project

**Thoughts:** React is a whole new beast to tame, I'm feeling overwhelmed on grasping it but little by little I'm making progress. States and props are starting to make more sense to me, and the general flow of data from parent to child


### Day 95: October 11, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Worked on cv-project

**Thoughts:** Document flow is data travels down and actions travel up, trying to instill that in my code. Figured out how to event handle more but struggling on when to apply what. Furthermore, unsure of how I'm supposed to remove and re-render elements 


### Day 96: October 12, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Worked on cv-project

**Thoughts:** I HAD A BREAKTHROUGH! Everything started to click, I feel so much more comfortable with state and props. The flow of code, everything. SUPER HAPPY


### Day 97: October 13, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Worked on cv-project

**Thoughts:** Started working on styling, need to figure out how to create and add to dom dynamically


### Day 98: October 14, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Worked on cv-project

**Thoughts:** Added logic for education and experience section. Figured out how to dynamically create more dom stuff with react by creating arrays and pushing them dynamically. Need to add unique id's still and also figure out how to delete stuff.



### Day 99: October 15, 2021

**Today's Progress**: (likely) finished cv project

**Thoughts:** My logic is sound and it can be improved slightly (specifically how I stored the general info). Style is what I would really improve on but for now I don't have an interest in doing so and would rather move onto the next thing.

100 days already since I started TOP. I've come a long way and have learned various skills and knowledge that I had none of before, feeling good and will continue to strive for more.



### Day 100: October 16, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learned about Hooks, started transitioning cv-project to be hooks based

**Thoughts:** Hooks are game changing, taking the flow of logic I'm most comfortable with and combining it with react is immensely powerful. Started changing my cv-project to be hooks based and the logic flowed so naturally.


### Day 101: October 22, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished turning cv-project to be hook based

**Thoughts:** Had a lot of trouble figuring out how to pass data and functions between hook based components, eventually solved it but still a bit shaky on the logic.


### Day 102: October 23, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Started memory game

**Thoughts:** Was overcomplicating things, need to work on downsizing the problem and really understanding what I'm trying to make before I make it
