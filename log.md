# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 14, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Setup Linux/Xubuntu. Messed around with command line with the native terminal.

**Thoughts:** Fairly simplistic and easy so far, just making progress with the Odin Project


### Day 1: June 15, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learned about Git and Github, practiced making a repository and pushing/pulling to it from the command line. Next I have to work through the responsive web design through free code camp.

**Thoughts:** Pretty cool feature, github is still a little confusing to me.


### Day 2: June 16, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Went through free code camps CSS lessons, and am now working on their applied visual design lessons

**Thoughts:** Since I've done CS50 before I had experience with CSS, but I was still able to learn new things and found the tutorials to be quite informative. 


### Day 3: June 17, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Continued freecodecamps lessons. Finished applied visual design lessons, applied accessibility, and responsive web design principles.

**Thoughts:** Most of the features I learned today with CSS were completely new to me, and greatly opened my eyes on how in depth the style can be. The accessbility knowledge was cool as well, as it was something I had never put much thought into before.
