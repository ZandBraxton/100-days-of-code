# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 14, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Setup Linux/Xubuntu. Messed around with command line with the native terminal.

**Thoughts:** Fairly simplistic and easy so far, just making progress with the Odin Project


### Day 1: June 15, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learned about Git and Github, practiced making a repository and pushing/pulling to it from the command line. Next I have to work through the responsive web design through free code camp.

**Thoughts:** Pretty cool feature, github is still a little confusing to me.


### Day 2: June 16, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Went through free code camps CSS lessons, and am now working on their applied visual design lessons

**Thoughts:** Since I've done CS50 before I had experience with CSS, but I was still able to learn new things and found the tutorials to be quite informative. 


### Day 3: June 17, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Continued freecodecamps lessons. Finished applied visual design lessons, applied accessibility, and responsive web design principles.

**Thoughts:** Most of the features I learned today with CSS were completely new to me, and greatly opened my eyes on how in depth the style can be. The accessbility knowledge was cool as well, as it was something I had never put much thought into before.


### Day 4: June 18, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished the flexbox and grid lessons in freecodecamp, now I have to make five different web pages.

**Thoughts:** Thoroughly enjoyed the lessons as I had messed with these concepts back in CS50, but never had a proper understanding for how they worked. Now ready to start on the webpages.


### Day 5: June 19, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Started on the tribute page, finished up 8/10 user stories. Used and learned a lot about CSS and some html.

**Thoughts:** Making good progress and can feel myself retaining what I'm learning, the webpage will be simple but I'm feeling good about what I've made so far.


### Day 6: June 20, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Spent hours messing around with CSS, didn't make much progress on the site at all.

**Thoughts:** Struggled to comprehend many aspects of CSS, saddened by how much time I spent on it but hopefully next time will be better.


### Day 7: June 21, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished the tribute webpage with all tests passing.

**Thoughts:** Compared to yesterday, today's progress was efficient and I finished the page with ease. It's simplistic, but I'm happy with it.


### Day 8: June 22, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Created and finished the survey webpage.

**Thoughts:** Functionality was easy and I found myself finishing it within the hour. The CSS is still difficult for me to I found myself mostly copying FCC's example. However, I learned a lot more about CSS by doing so.


### Day 9: June 23, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Created the product landing webpage.

**Thoughts:** Was a busier today so didn't have as much time. Manged to create the navbar easily with functionality. CSS is coming more naturally to me now and I find myself grasping more concepts more easily.


### Day 10: June 24, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Created the email submission and aligned the layout with flex, played around with more css functions. Also applied fixed position to navbar.

**Thoughts:** Only an hour today but didn't struggle as much as I thought I would. Css is slowly becoming easier and more intuitive the more I use it. Still need to mess with grid further as well.


### Day 11: June 25, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished the landing site, then started on the tech documentation site. 

**Thoughts:** Landing site didn't really teach me anything new but helped my muscle memory, tech site should be fairly simple


### Day 12: June 26, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished the tech doc site.

**Thoughts:** In terms of the subject, I merely copied the example. However, all the code I wrote myself. Learned more about media queries today, as well as how to make better navbars.


### Day 13: June 27, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Started the portfolio site.

**Thoughts:** Getting much more comfortable with CSS and HTML by this point, finding myself needing to google less and can create and manipulate what I want mostly from memory. Overall happy!


### Day 14: June 28, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished the portfolio site

**Thoughts:** In terms of the site layout I feel I did a fine job, however I couldn't figure out how to design it for mobile. I played around with media queries but it's still really confusing. In the future I'll consider designing sites for mobile as the priority.


### Day 15: June 29, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Started google homepage

**Thoughts:** Have to recreat google homepage. Learned about google free fonts and icons, created a pretty good search bar as well. Feeling more confidant with CSS and html.


### Day 16: June 30, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished google homepage

**Thoughts:** It's nearly identical to the original homepage! I can tell that I've improved a lot.


### Day 17: July 1, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Worked on JS fundamentals in TOP

**Thoughts:** Learned about declaring variables, delcarations to avoid, numbers and arithmatic, precedence in operators, unary and binary, pre-fixing and post-fixing. As well as a few other minor things.


### Day 18: July 2, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learned more JS fundamentals, such as syntax, common datatypes, boolean and condition stuff

**Thoughts:** Nothing too crazy, just absorbing the new syntax


### Day 19: July 3, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Continued JS fundamentals. Polished my knowledge on datatpes, conditions, switchs, did some js exercises.

**Thoughts:** Getting more comrortable with the syntax now


### Day 20: July 4, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Worked on JS functions.

**Thoughts:** It was good to brush up on them since it's been a while since I used them in CS50, learned the difference between func delcarations and func expressions. As well as arrow functions


### Day 21: July 5, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Worked on problem solving skills

**Thoughts:** Watched an hour lecture on how to think like a programmer, which really focused on the right steps and mindset to have. I feel like this is a part of me I have neglected and am going to work hard to change it and improve my mindset


### Day 22: July 6, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Created Rock, Paper, Scissors

**Thoughts:** Created a JS program that replicates an RPS game. I utilized functions almost entirely, switch statements, while loops, and more. Comparatively to weeks ago, it all came relatively easy and I feel proud of my growth


### Day 23: July 7, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learned about arrays

**Thoughts:** Very short day, had lots of trouble focusing. Just going to take it easy.


### Day 24: July 8, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learned more about JS loops.

**Thoughts:** Not that different from loops in other languages, althought a refresher was nice


### Day 25: July 8, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Went through various JS exercises

**Thoughts:** Still running through fundamentals on TOP, did various JS exercises such as temp conversion, sumall, removeFromArray, repeatString, leapYear, and a couple more. Not too challenging, the syntax is starting to really stick


### Day 26: July 11, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learned about DOM and became more familar with it

**Thoughts:** Learned a bit on the JS syntax. Next projects focus on recreating a drum-kit and also adding a UI to my rock, paper, scissors game


### Day 27: July 12, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Worked on and finished the drum kit

**Thoughts:** I feel like I had the right ideas, but was unable to complete the project on my own due to lack of syntax and general knowledge of DOM. In particlar, query selectors and keycodes were confusing before watching the tutorial.


### Day 28: July 13, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the RPS project

**Thoughts:** Got stumped for a while because I accidentally called my script file twice, thus redeclaring everything and giving me errors. Then got stumped on how to update the score in real time, decided to make it a function and just recall it each time the score updated. Overall not too bad.


### Day 29: July 15, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished the RPS project

**Thoughts:** I thought that I did everything right, but when I tested "playing again", the game broke. I got stuck for a while but after trial and error I understood my mistakes, such as calling a function more than I should have and ways to simplify things with more functions. 


### Day 30: July 16, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Started the Etch-a-sketch project

**Thoughts:** Worked more with grid which was cool, understanding how it works a lot more. Created a dynamic grid along with the function to change color. Next I need to implement a refresh button, and possible a grander color changer.


### Day 31: July 18, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished Etch-a-Sketch

**Thoughts:** Implemented the ability to change grid size. When I finished it, it was very barebones. After looking at a few examples from other students, I was able to spice mine up further while only using my own knowledge to do so. I could add more, such as different colors and functions. For now I'm satisfied


### Day 32: July 19, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learned about JS objects, did various array exercises and learned about array-specific functions such as map, sort, find, reduce. Also completed two JS exercises, calculator and palindromes

**Thoughts:** JS objects were incredibly similar to Python disctionaries, so that knowledge made my understanding of it increasingly easier. The array exercises were all easy except for reduce, but I feel better about it now. Calculator was simplistic, palindromes I completed but I know it could be much more optimal.


### Day 33: July 20, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished Js exercises.

**Thoughts:** Short session, I've got a much better grasp on JS syntax now. Tomorrow I start on the big calculator project


### Day 34: July 21, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Started Calculator project

**Thoughts:** The ability to use Grid suddenly clicked with me as I easily created the calculators format, the css was really easy too. I got majority of the functionality down but I feel like there's plenty of room for improvement.


### Day 35: July 22, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Worked on calculator 

**Thoughts:** Spent the entire time bug fixing. Clear wasn't functioning right but I think I got it sorted. Also the operators functioned weird if you used them back-to-back without selecting a new value each time. Also believe to have fixed them. Still need to fix decimals, percent, number limiter, add backspace, and add keyboard functionality 


### Day 36: July 23, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Worked on calculator, finished for now.

**Thoughts:** Spent more time bugfixing. Not entirely satisified with it and believe it can be improved still, but I'll save that for another day. It's basic functions work just fine, although I'm sure I could improve the way I coded it as well. 



### Day 37: July 25, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Started Fullstack JS, Javascript lessons. Learned about object prototypes and inheritance.

**Thoughts:** Still slightly confusing, but I think I managed a good grasp on the concept.


### Day 38: July 26, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Started Library project

**Thoughts:** Figured out how to make a responsive table entirely through js manipulating the DOM. Got more comfortable using objects as well.



### Day 39: July 27, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Library project

**Thoughts:** Feeling very comfortable manipulating the DOM. Created a few functions easily, now attempting to make the program more dynamic



### Day 40: July 28, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Library project

**Thoughts:** Feeling very happy with my progress. Funcionality of the project so far is perfect, the code is clean with plenty of functions (but not too many). I managed to use JSON to store localstorage. Now I only need to add better CSS



### Day 41: July 29, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Library project

**Thoughts:** Mostly worked on CSS, which I'm so much more comfortble with now. Need to upgrade the CSS of the actual book cells next



### Day 42: July 30, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished Library project

**Thoughts:** Very satisfied with the final result!


### Day 43: July 31, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learned about JS factory functions and modules

**Thoughts:** Extremely confused about all of this, going to watch more tutorials and read more docs on the process because I don't quite get it. Have to start the tic-tac-toe project next which will make use of this knowledge as well


### Day 44: August 1st, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Started tic-tac-toe

**Thoughts:** After watching the tutorials I'm much less confused on modules and factories. However, tic-tac-toe is proving to be very difficult for me and I'm struggling hard. 


### Day 45: August 2, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Worked on tic-tac-toe

**Thoughts:** Extremely short day, didn't get to do much. But I have a better understanding on modules


### Day 46: August 3, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Worked on tic-tac-toe

**Thoughts:** Added some more functions, improved my modules, added style. so far so good



### Day 47: August 4, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished tic-tac-toe

**Thoughts:** Finalized it! Feeling pretty accomplished with my work, curious as to where I can go to have someone critique my code. 


### Day 48: August 5, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learned about JS classes

**Thoughts:** Pretty confusing at first but eventually I started to understand it, but as of now I don't really see much of a big use other than it just being syntax sugar


### Day 49: August 6, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learned about ES6 modules, NPM, and webpack

**Thoughts:** A bit overwhelming but I grasp the concept, now I just need to really learn and utilize the aspects of it in practice



### Day 50: August 8, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Continued to learn about webpack and making servers with it

**Thoughts:** Starting to understand NPM and webpack a lot more, but it'll be a while before I'm really comfortable with it. Have to start the restaurant project now


### Day 51: August 9, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Started on restaurant project

**Thoughts:** exporting and importing is really confusing right now, mostly the concept of importing/exporting module syntax.
