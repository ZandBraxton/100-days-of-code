# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 14, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Setup Linux/Xubuntu. Messed around with command line with the native terminal.

**Thoughts:** Fairly simplistic and easy so far, just making progress with the Odin Project


### Day 1: June 15, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learned about Git and Github, practiced making a repository and pushing/pulling to it from the command line. Next I have to work through the responsive web design through free code camp.

**Thoughts:** Pretty cool feature, github is still a little confusing to me.


### Day 2: June 16, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Went through free code camps CSS lessons, and am now working on their applied visual design lessons

**Thoughts:** Since I've done CS50 before I had experience with CSS, but I was still able to learn new things and found the tutorials to be quite informative. 


### Day 3: June 17, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Continued freecodecamps lessons. Finished applied visual design lessons, applied accessibility, and responsive web design principles.

**Thoughts:** Most of the features I learned today with CSS were completely new to me, and greatly opened my eyes on how in depth the style can be. The accessbility knowledge was cool as well, as it was something I had never put much thought into before.


### Day 4: June 18, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished the flexbox and grid lessons in freecodecamp, now I have to make five different web pages.

**Thoughts:** Thoroughly enjoyed the lessons as I had messed with these concepts back in CS50, but never had a proper understanding for how they worked. Now ready to start on the webpages.


### Day 5: June 19, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Started on the tribute page, finished up 8/10 user stories. Used and learned a lot about CSS and some html.

**Thoughts:** Making good progress and can feel myself retaining what I'm learning, the webpage will be simple but I'm feeling good about what I've made so far.


### Day 6: June 20, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Spent hours messing around with CSS, didn't make much progress on the site at all.

**Thoughts:** Struggled to comprehend many aspects of CSS, saddened by how much time I spent on it but hopefully next time will be better.


### Day 7: June 21, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished the tribute webpage with all tests passing.

**Thoughts:** Compared to yesterday, today's progress was efficient and I finished the page with ease. It's simplistic, but I'm happy with it.


### Day 8: June 22, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Created and finished the survey webpage.

**Thoughts:** Functionality was easy and I found myself finishing it within the hour. The CSS is still difficult for me to I found myself mostly copying FCC's example. However, I learned a lot more about CSS by doing so.


### Day 9: June 23, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Created the product landing webpage.

**Thoughts:** Was a busier today so didn't have as much time. Manged to create the navbar easily with functionality. CSS is coming more naturally to me now and I find myself grasping more concepts more easily.


### Day 10: June 24, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Created the email submission and aligned the layout with flex, played around with more css functions. Also applied fixed position to navbar.

**Thoughts:** Only an hour today but didn't struggle as much as I thought I would. Css is slowly becoming easier and more intuitive the more I use it. Still need to mess with grid further as well.


### Day 11: June 25, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished the landing site, then started on the tech documentation site. 

**Thoughts:** Landing site didn't really teach me anything new but helped my muscle memory, tech site should be fairly simple


### Day 12: June 26, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished the tech doc site.

**Thoughts:** In terms of the subject, I merely copied the example. However, all the code I wrote myself. Learned more about media queries today, as well as how to make better navbars.


### Day 13: June 27, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Started the portfolio site.

**Thoughts:** Getting much more comfortable with CSS and HTML by this point, finding myself needing to google less and can create and manipulate what I want mostly from memory. Overall happy!


### Day 14: June 28, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished the portfolio site

**Thoughts:** In terms of the site layout I feel I did a fine job, however I couldn't figure out how to design it for mobile. I played around with media queries but it's still really confusing. In the future I'll consider designing sites for mobile as the priority.


### Day 15: June 29, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Started google homepage

**Thoughts:** Have to recreat google homepage. Learned about google free fonts and icons, created a pretty good search bar as well. Feeling more confidant with CSS and html.


### Day 16: June 30, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished google homepage

**Thoughts:** It's nearly identical to the original homepage! I can tell that I've improved a lot.


### Day 17: July 1, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Worked on JS fundamentals in TOP

**Thoughts:** Learned about declaring variables, delcarations to avoid, numbers and arithmatic, precedence in operators, unary and binary, pre-fixing and post-fixing. As well as a few other minor things.


### Day 18: July 2, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learned more JS fundamentals, such as syntax, common datatypes, boolean and condition stuff

**Thoughts:** Nothing too crazy, just absorbing the new syntax


### Day 19: July 3, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Continued JS fundamentals. Polished my knowledge on datatpes, conditions, switchs, did some js exercises.

**Thoughts:** Getting more comrortable with the syntax now


### Day 20: July 4, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Worked on JS functions.

**Thoughts:** It was good to brush up on them since it's been a while since I used them in CS50, learned the difference between func delcarations and func expressions. As well as arrow functions


### Day 21: July 5, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Worked on problem solving skills

**Thoughts:** Watched an hour lecture on how to think like a programmer, which really focused on the right steps and mindset to have. I feel like this is a part of me I have neglected and am going to work hard to change it and improve my mindset


### Day 22: July 6, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Created Rock, Paper, Scissors

**Thoughts:** Created a JS program that replicates an RPS game. I utilized functions almost entirely, switch statements, while loops, and more. Comparatively to weeks ago, it all came relatively easy and I feel proud of my growth


### Day 23: July 7, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Learned about arrays

**Thoughts:** Very short day, had lots of trouble focusing. Just going to take it easy.


### Day 24: July 8, 2021
