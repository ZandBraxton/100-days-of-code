**Today's Progress**: Setup Linux/Xubuntu. Messed around with command line with the native terminal.

**Thoughts:** Fairly simplistic and easy so far, just making progress with the Odin Project

**Today's Progress**: Learned about Git and Github, practiced making a repository and pushing/pulling to it from the command line. Next I have to work through the responsive web design through free code camp.

**Thoughts:** Pretty cool feature, github is still a little confusing to me.
